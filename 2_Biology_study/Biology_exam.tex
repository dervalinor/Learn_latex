\section{Introduction}

The protein synthesis machinery includes the large and small subunits of the ribosome, 
mRNA, and tRNA. A ribosome is a complex macromolecule composed of structural and catalytic rRNAs, 
and many distinct polypeptides.

\subsection{Protein Synthesis Steps}

Protein synthesis is the process by which cells make proteins. It occurs in two stages: transcription and translation

\begin{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Transcription}  is the transfer of genetic instructions in DNA
to mRNA in the nucleus \cite{proteinsynthesis1}.
  \item \textbf{Translation} involves ribosomes and several other cytoplasmic
factors, which play important roles during this process \cite{proteinsynthesis2}.

\end{itemize}
